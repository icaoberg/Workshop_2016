# Workshop 2016 - CellBlender
## Repository for CellBlender models, descriptions, and code to be used for the 2016 Workshop.

This directory contains files and documentation for the CellBlender portion of the 2016 Workshop.

This is the basic "Organelle" model that we have used in other tutorials. This particular version
was completely generated within CellBlender, but portions (geometry, reactions, etc) might be imported
from other tools.
