# Workshop_2016
## Repository for models, descriptions, and code to be used for the 2016 Workshop.

Ideally we would like the 2016 workshop to demonstrate a pipelining of our tools using a single multi-scale model. However, since many of our tools operator on different scales, it may be necessary to simplify certain aspects of the model or otherwise address the multi-scale issue.

This repository has been created as a place to work out an appropriate model for the workshop consistent with our February 25th decision.

At this point, the candidate tools for such a joint model are:

* **CellBlender**
* **MCell**
* **BioNetGen**
* **Cell Organizer**

Please feel free to add/delete tools that might participate in this portion of the workshop.
